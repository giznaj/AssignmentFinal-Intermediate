Alien Hunt 1.0
Aaron Toth
300770784


version update:

-fixed a bugs
-declared things better of the same type
-added current high scores to the applet
-added HTML file for running via a browser (JAlienHunt.html)
-app checks for Mark or Aaron's path (file saving)


open issues:
1) after a game is running, the user can toggle the sound off, then back on.  This means they can play music while there is 
no active game running.  This is intended.  If I set a boolean for gameInProgress to false, then the last paint method never gets 
displayed so you don't see the last alien uncovered.  fixed in next version.

2) if a user plays more than 1 game in a minutes time, the time stamp could be the exact same (only displays to seconds).  This will 
be fixed in the next version.
